## Requirements ##

Requires Ruby 2.1.0 or greater.

## Installation ##

Kookaburra is available as a Rubygem and
[published on Rubygems.org] [Kookaburra Gem], so installation is trivial:

    gem install kookaburra

If you're using [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) for your project, just add the
following:

    group :development, :test do
      gem 'kookaburra'
    end

## Setup ##

Kookaburra abstracts some common patterns for implementing the Window
Driver testing pattern for web applications. You will need to tell
Kookaburra which classes contain the specific Domain Driver
implementations for your application as well as which driver to use for
running the tests (currently only tested with [Capybara] [Capybara]).

Kookaburra is designed to run tests against one or more remote web
servers (although the server(s) could be running on the same machine, it
doesn't need to be), and it is the responsibility of the test
implementation to ensure that the server is running. 

The fact that Kookaburra runs against a remote server means that *it is
not limited to testing only Ruby web applications*. As long as your
application exposes a web-service API for use by the APIDriver and an
HTML user interface for use by the UIDriver, you can use Kookaburra to
test it. Also, as long as you're careful with both your application and
test designs, you're not limited to running your tests only in an
isolated testing environment; you could run the same test suite you use
for development against your staging or production systems.

### Testing an Application Running Locally ###

The fact that Kookaburra is designed to support running tests against a
remote server does not, of course, mean that the application cannot be
running locally.  It is possible to have your test suite manage the
process of starting and stopping your server(s) for you. Examples of how
to do so with a Rack application are presented below, but you should be
able to take the same basic approach with other types of application
servers.

Although Capybara is capable of starting a Rack application server on
its own, the default setup only starts the server up on-demand when you
call a method that requires the browser to interact with the web
application. Because the APIClient layer does not use Capybara, it is
necessary to manage the server process on your own. Otherwise the server
would not be guaranteed to be running when you call the APIClient
methods (particularly as these often appear in "Given" statements that
are run before you start interacting with the web browser.)

**Keep in mind that, even if your server is capable of being started up in
another thread within the same Ruby process that is executing your test
suite, you will want to avoid doing so unless you are using a Ruby
interpreter that supports native threads. Otherwise, when the APIClient
makes an HTTP call to your application's API, it will block while
waiting for a response, thus preventing your application from being able
to respond to that request and resulting in a timeout error in your
tests.**

### RSpec ###

The following examples depict how you might configure RSpec to run tests against
an already running application server (e.g. a remote staging site) and a Rack
application server that is managed by the test suite.

#### Testing an already running server ####

If you are running your tests against an already running server, you can simply
add the following to `spec/support/kookaburra_setup.rb`:

    require 'kookaburra/test_helpers'

    # Change these to the files that define your custom APIDriver and UIDriver
    # implementations.
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/api_driver'
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/ui_driver'

    # c.app_host below should be set to whatever the root URL of your running
    # application is.
    Kookaburra.configure do |c|
      c.api_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::APIDriver
      c.ui_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver
      c.app_host = 'http://my_app.example.com:1234'
      c.browser = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium)
      c.server_error_detection { |browser|
        browser.has_css?('head title', :text => 'Internal Server Error')
      }
    end

    RSpec.configure do |c|
      # Makes the #k, #api and #ui methods available to your specs
      # (See section on test implementation below)
      c.include(Kookaburra::TestHelpers, :type => :request)
    end

#### Testing Multiple Applications

Sometimes you need to test a business process that spans multiple
"applications" in your platform. Kookaburra can be configured to operate
against multiple remote applications by defining them in the
configuration block as follows:

    Kookaburra.configure do |c|
      c.application(:app_one) do |a|
        a.api_driver_class = AppOne::APIDriver
        a.ui_driver_class = AppOne::UIDriver
        a.app_host = 'http://app_one.example.com:1234'
      end

      c.application(:app_two) do |a|
        a.api_driver_class = AppTwo::APIDriver
        a.ui_driver_class = AppTwo::UIDriver
        a.app_host = 'http://app_two.example.com:1234'
      end

      c.browser = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium)
      c.server_error_detection { |browser|
        browser.has_css?('head title', :text => 'Internal Server Error')
      }
    end

This changes the way you use the `#api` and `#ui` test helpers
(explained below) so that you must qualify each one with the name of the
application, i.e. `#app_one.api`, and `#app_two.ui`. Configuration
parameters set on the base configuration (e.g. `c.browser = #...`) are
shared between all named applications that do not specifically override
them.

#### Managing startup and shutdown of a Rack application server ####

While developing, it can be helpful to run your integration specs
against a locally-running server that is managed by your test suite. The
setup is similar to that in the previous section, but it adds before and
after hooks to launch and shut down a Rack application server. Just add
the following to `spec/support/kookaburra_setup.rb`:

    require 'kookaburra/test_helpers'
    require 'kookaburra/rack_app_server'

    # Change these to the files that define your custom APIDriver and UIDriver
    # implementations.
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/api_driver'
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/ui_driver'

    # `MyApplication` below should be replaced with the object that
    # implements the Rack `#call` interface for your application. For a
    # Rails app, this would be along the lines of
    # `MyAppName::Application`.
    app_server = Kookaburra::RackAppServer.new do
      require 'path/to/my_application'
      MyApplication
    end

    # c.app_host below should be set to whatever the root URL of your
    # running application is.
    Kookaburra.configure do |c|
      c.api_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::APIDriver
      c.ui_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver
      c.app_host = 'http://localhost:%d' % app_server.port
      c.browser = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium)
      c.server_error_detection { |browser|
        browser.has_css?('head title', :text => 'Internal Server Error')
      }
    end

    RSpec.configure do |c|
      c.include(Kookaburra::TestHelpers, :type => :request)

      c.before(:all, :type => :request) do
        app_server.boot
      end

      c.after(:all, :type => :request) do
        app_server.shutdown
      end
    end

### Cucumber ###

The following examples depict how you might configure [Cucumber]
[Cucumber] to run tests against an already running application server
(e.g. a remote staging site) and a Rack application server that is
managed by the test suite.

#### Testing an already running server ####

If you are running your tests against an already running server, you can
simply add the following to `features/support/kookaburra_setup.rb`:

    require 'kookaburra/test_helpers'

    # Change these to the files that define your custom APIDriver and UIDriver
    # implementations.
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/api_driver'
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/ui_driver'

    # c.app_host below should be set to whatever the root URL of your running
    # application is.
    Kookaburra.configure do |c|
      c.api_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::APIDriver
      c.ui_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver
      c.app_host = 'http://my_app.example.com:1234'
      c.browser = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium)
      c.server_error_detection { |browser|
        browser.has_css?('head title', :text => 'Internal Server Error')
      }
    end

    World(Kookaburra::TestHelpers)

#### Testing Multiple Applications

Sometimes you need to test a business process that spans multiple
"applications" in your platform. Kookaburra can be configured to operate
against multiple remote applications by defining them in the
configuration block as follows:

    Kookaburra.configure do |c|
      c.application(:app_one) do |a|
        a.api_driver_class = AppOne::APIDriver
        a.ui_driver_class = AppOne::UIDriver
        a.app_host = 'http://app_one.example.com:1234'
      end

      c.application(:app_two) do |a|
        a.api_driver_class = AppTwo::APIDriver
        a.ui_driver_class = AppTwo::UIDriver
        a.app_host = 'http://app_two.example.com:1234'
      end

      c.browser = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium)
      c.server_error_detection { |browser|
        browser.has_css?('head title', :text => 'Internal Server Error')
      }
    end

This changes the way you use the `#api` and `#ui` test helpers
(explained below) so that you must qualify each one with the name of the
application, i.e. `#app_one.api`, and `#app_two.ui`. Configuration
parameters set on the base configuration (e.g. `c.browser = #...`) are
shared between all named applications that do not specifically override
them.

#### Managing startup and shutdown of a Rack application server ####

While developing, it can be helpful to run your acceptance tests against
a locally-running server that is managed by your test suite. The setup
is similar to that in the previous section, but it adds before and after
hooks to launch and shut down a Rack application server. Just add the
following to `features/support/kookaburra_setup.rb`:

    require 'kookaburra/test_helpers'
    require 'kookaburra/rack_app_server'

    # Change these to the files that define your custom APIDriver and UIDriver
    # implementations.
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/api_driver'
    require 'my_app/kookaburra/ui_driver'

    # `MyApplication` below should be replaced with the object that
    # implements the Rack `#call` interface for your application. For a
    # Rails app, this would be along the lines of
    # `MyAppName::Application`.
    app_server = Kookaburra::RackAppServer.new do
      require 'path/to/my_application'
      MyApplication
    end

    # c.app_host below should be set to whatever the root URL of your
    # running application is.
    Kookaburra.configure do |c|
      c.api_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::APIDriver
      c.ui_driver_class = MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver
      c.app_host = 'http://localhost:%d' % app_server.port
      c.browser = Capybara::Session.new(:selenium)
      c.server_error_detection { |browser|
        browser.has_css?('head title', :text => 'Internal Server Error')
      }
    end

    World(Kookaburra::TestHelpers)

    app_server.boot

    at_exit do
      app_server.shutdown
    end

## Defining Your Testing DSL ##

Kookaburra extracts some common patterns that make it easier to use the
Window Driver pattern along with various Ruby testing frameworks, but
you still need to define your own testing DSL. An acceptance testing
stack using Kookaburra has the following layers:

1. The **Business Specification Language** (Cucumber scenarios or other
   spcification documents)
2. The **Test Implementation** (Cucumber step definitions, RSpec example blocks,
   etc.)
3. The **Domain Driver** (Kookaburra::APIDriver and Kookaburra::UIDriver)
4. The **Window Driver** (Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent)
5. The **Application Driver** (Capybara and Kookaburra::APIClient)

### The Business Specification Language ###

The business specification language consists of the highest-level
descriptions of a feature that are suitable for sharing with the
non/less-technical stakeholders on a project.

Gherkin is the external DSL used by Cucumber for this purpose, and you
might have the following scenario defined for an e-commerce application:

    # purchase_items_in_cart.feature

    Feature: Purchase Items in Cart

      Scenario: Using Existing Billing and Shipping Information

        Given I have an existing account
        And I have previously specified default payment options
        And I have previously specified default shipping options
        And I have an item in my shopping cart

        When I sign in to my account
        And I choose to check out

        Then I see my order summary
        And I see that my default payment options will be used
        And I see that my default shipping options will be used

Note that the scenario is focused on business concepts versus interface
details, i.e. you "choose to check out" rather than "click on the
checkout button". If for some reason your e-commerce system was going to
be a terminal application rather than a web application, you would not
need to change this scenario at all, because the actual business
concepts described would not change (and although Kookaburra's focus is
on testing web applications, it could likely be adapted to other
environments.)

### The Test Implementation ###

The Test Implementation layer exists as the line in between the Business
Specification Language and the Domain Driver, and it includes Cucumber
step definitions, RSpec example blocks, Test::Unit tests, etc. At this
layer, your code orchestrates calls into the Domain Driver to mimic user
interactions under various conditions and make assertions about the
results.

**Test assertions always belong within the test implementation layer.**
Some testing frameworks such as RSpec add methods like `#should` to
`Object`, which has the effect of poisoning the entire Ruby namespace
with these methods---if you are using RSpec, you can call `#should`
anywhere in your code and it will work when RSpec is loaded. Do not be
tempted to call a testing library's Object decorators anywhere outside
of your test implementation (such as within `UIDriver` or `UIComponent`
subclasses.) Doing so will tightly couple your Domain Driver and/or
Window Driver implementation to a specific testing library.

`Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent` provides an `#assert` method for use
inside your own UIComponents. This method exists to verify preconditions
and provide more informative error messages; it is not intended to be
used for test verifications.

Given the Cucumber scenario above, here is how the test implementation layer
might look:

    # step_definitions/various_steps.rb

    Given "I have an existing account" do
      api.existing_account
    end

    Given "I have previously specified default payment options" do
      api.default_payment_options_specified
    end

    Given "I have previously specified default shipping options" do
      api.default_shipping_options_specified
    end

    Given "I have an item in my shopping cart" do
      api.an_item_in_my_shopping_cart
    end

    When "I sign in to my account" do
      ui.sign_in
    end

    When "I choose to check out" do
      ui.choose_to_check_out
    end

    Then "I see my order summary" do
      ui.order_summary.should be_visible
    end

    Then "I see that my default payment options will be used" do
      expect(ui.order_summary.payment_options).to \
        eq get_data(:payment_optons)[:default]
    end

    Then "I see that my default shipping options will be used" do
      expect(ui.order_summary.shipping_options).to \
        eq get_data(:shipping_options)[:default]
    end

The step definitions contain neither explicitly shared state (instance
variables) nor any logic branches; they are simply wrappers around calls
into the Domain Driver layer. There are a couple of advantages to this
approach.

First, because step definitions are so simple, it isn't necessary to
force *Very Specific Wording* on the business analyst/product owner who
is writing the specs. For instance, if she writes "I see a summary of my
order" in another scenario, it's not a big deal to have the following in
your step definitions (as long as the author of the spec confirms that
they really mean the same thing):

    Then "I see my order summary" do
      ui.order_summary.should be_visible
    end

    Then "I see a summary of my order" do
      ui.order_summary.should be_visible
    end

The step definitions are nothing more than a natural language reference
to an action in the Domain Driver; there is no overwhelming maintenance
cost to the slight duplication, and it opens up the capacity for more
readable Gherkin specs. The fewer false road blocks you put between your
product owner and a written specification, the easier it becomes to
ensure her participation in this process.

The second advantage is that by pushing all of the complexity down into
the Domain Driver, it's now trivial to reuse the exact same code in
developer-centric integration tests. This ensures you have parity
between the way the automated acceptance tests run and any additional
testing that the development team needs to add in.

Using RSpec, the test implementation would be as follows:

    # spec/integration/purchase_items_in_cart_spec.rb
    
    describe "Purchase Items in Cart" do
      example "Using Existing Billing and Shipping Information" do
        api.existing_account(:my_account)
        api.default_payment_options_specified
        api.default_shipping_options_specified
        api.an_item_in_my_shopping_cart

        ui.sign_in
        ui.choose_to_check_out

        expect(ui.order_summary).to be_visible
        expect(ui.order_summary.payment_options).to \
          eq get_data(:payment_optons)[:default]

        expect(ui.order_summary.shipping_options).to \
          eq get_data(:shipping_options)[:default]
      end
    end

### The Domain Driver ###

The Domain Driver layer is where you build up an internal DSL that
describes the business concepts of your application at a fairly high
level. It consists of two top-level drivers: the `APIDriver` (available
via `#api`) used to set up state for your tests and the UIDriver
(available via `#ui`) for describing the tasks that a user can
accomplish with the application.

#### Mental Model ####

`Kookaburra::MentalModel` is the component via which the `APIDriver` and
the `UIDriver` share information, and it is intended to represent your
application user's mental picture of the data they are working with. For
instance, if you create a user account via the `APIDriver`, you would
store the login credentials for that account in the `MentalModel`
instance, so the `UIDriver` knows what to use when you tell it to
`#sign_in`. This is what allows the Cucumber step definitions to remain
free from explicitly shared state.

Kookaburra automatically configures your `APIDriver` and your `UIDriver`
to share a `MentalModel` instance, which is available to both of them
via their `#mental_model` method.

The `MentalModel` instance will return a `MentalModel::Collection` for
any method called on the object. The `MentalModel::Collection` object
behaves like a `Hash` for the most part; however, it will raise a
`Kookaburra::UnknownKeyError` if you try to access a key that has not
yet been assigned a value.

Deletions (via `#delete` or `#delete_if`) will actually remove the
key/value pair from the collection, but add it to a sub-collection
(available at `MentalModel::Collection#deleted`). This reflects the fact
that the user's mental model of the dataset would also include any
intentional exceptions - the user will, for example, want to verify that
an item they deleted does not appear to be available in the system.

Here's an example of MentalModel behavior:

    mental_model = MentalModel.new

    mental_model.widgets[:widget_a] = {'name' => 'Widget A'}

    mental_model.widgets[:widget_a]
    #=> {'name' => 'Widget A'}

    # this will raise a Kookaburra::UnknownKeyError
    mental_model.widgets[:widget_b]

    mental_model.widgets.delete(:widget_a)
    #=> {'name' => 'Widget A'}

    # this will now also raise a Kookaburra::UnknownKeyError...
    mental_model.widgets[:widget_a]

    # ...but the pair is now available here:
    mental_model.widgets.deleted[:widget_a]
    #=> {'name' => 'Widget A'}

#### API Driver ####

The `Kookaburra::APIDriver` is used to create a particular "preexisting"
state within your application's data and ensure you have a handle to
that data (when needed) prior to interacting with the UI. You will
create a subclass of `Kookaburra::APIDriver` in which you will create
part of the Domain Driver DSL for your application:

    # lib/my_app/kookaburra/api_driver.rb

    class MyApp::Kookaburra::APIDriver < Kookaburra::APIDriver
      # Specify the APIClient to use
      def api
        @api ||= MyApp::Kookaburra::APIClient.new(configuration)
      end

      def existing_account(nickname)
        account_data = {'display_name' => 'John Doe', 'password' => 'a password'}
        account_data['username'] = "test-user-#{`uuidgen`.strip}"

        # use the API to create the account in the application
        result = api.create_account(account_data)

        # merge in the password, since API (hopefully!) doesn't return it, and
        # store details in the MentalModel instance
        result.merge!('password' => account_data['password'])
        mental_model.accounts[nickname] = account_details
      end
    end

#### API Client ####

The `Kookaburra::APIClient` is used to interact with an application's
external web services API. You tell Kookaburra about your API by
creating a subclass of `Kookaburra::APIClient` for your application,
specifying how requests should be encoded and decoded, and specifying
any headers that should be present on every request.

    # lib/my_app/kookaburra/api_driver.rb

    class MyApp::Kookaburra::APIClient < Kookaburra::APIClient
      encode_with { |data| JSON.dump(data) }
      decode_with { |data| JSON.parse(data) }
      header 'Content-Type', 'application/json'
      header 'Accept', 'application/json'

      def create_account(account_data)
        post '/api/accounts', account_data
      end

      def get_account(id)
        get '/api/accounts/%d' % id
      end
    end

The content of your application's APIClient should consist mainly of
mappings between discrete actions and HTTP requests to the specified URL
paths.

#### UI Driver ####

`Kookaburra::UIDriver` provides the necessary tools for driving your
application's user interface with the Window Driver pattern. You will
subclass `Kookaburra::UIDriver` for your application and implement your
testing DSL within your subclass:

    # lib/my_app/kookaburra/ui_driver.rb

    class MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver < Kookaburra::UIDriver
      # makes an instance of MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver::SignInScreen
      # available via the instance method #sign_in_screen
      ui_component :sign_in_screen, SignInScreen

      def sign_in(account_nickname)
        account = mental_model.accounts[account_nickname]
        address_bar.go_to(sign_in_screen)
        sign_in_screen.submit_login(account['username'], account['password'])
      end
    end

### The Window Driver Layer ###

While your `APIDriver` and `UIDriver` provide a DSL that represents
actions your users can perform in your application, the
[Window Driver] [Window Driver] layer describes the individual user
interface components that the user interacts with to perform these
tasks. By describing each interface component using an OOP approach, it
is much easier to maintain your acceptance/integration tests, because
the implementation details of each component are captured in a single
place. For example, if/when the implementation of your application's
sign in screen changes, you can fix every single test that needs to log
a user into the system just by updating the `SignInScreen` class.

You describe the various user interface components by sub-classing
`Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent`:

    # lib/my_app/ui_driver/sign_in_screen.rb

    class MyApp::Kookaburra::UIDriver::SignInScreen < Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent
      def component_locator
        '#new_user_session'
      end

      def component_path
        '/session/new'
      end

      def username
        find('#session_username').value
      end

      def username=(new_value)
        fill_in '#session_username', :with => new_value
      end

      def password
        find('#session_password').value
      end

      def password=(new_value)
        fill_in '#session_password', :with => new_value
      end

      def submit
        click_on('Sign In')
      end

      def submit_login(username, password)
        self.username = username

### The Application Driver Layer ###

`Kookaburra::APIClient`, `Kookaburra::UIDriver` and
`Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent` rely on the Application Driver layer
to interact with your application. In the case of the `APIClient`,
Kookaburra uses the [RestClient] [RestClient] library to send HTTP
requests to your application. The `UIDriver` and `UIComponent` rely on
whatever is passed to `Kookaburra.new` as the `:browser` option.
Presently, we have only used Capybara as the application driver for
Kookaburra.

It's possible that something other than Capybara could be passed in, as
long as that something presented the same API. In reality, using
something other than Capybara is likely to require some changes to
Kookaburra itself. If you have a particular interest in making this
work, please feel free to fork the project and send us a [GitHub pull
request] [Pull Request] with your changes.

## Contributing to kookaburra ##
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented
  or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it
  and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to
  have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please
  isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
* Send us a [pull request] [Pull Request]
