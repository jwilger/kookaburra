# Kookaburra #

Kookaburra is a framework for implementing the [Window Driver] [1] pattern in
order to keep acceptance tests maintainable.

## Setup ##

Kookaburra itself abstracts some common patterns for implementing the Window
Driver pattern for tests of Ruby web applications built on [Rack] [2]. You will need
to tell Kookaburra which classes contain the specific Domain Driver
implementations for your application as well as which driver to use for running
the tests (currently only tested with [Capybara] [3]). The details of setting up your
Domain Driver layer are discussed below, but in general you will need the
following in a locations such as `lib/my_application/kookaburra.rb` (replace
`MyApplication` with a module name suitable to your actual application:

    module MyApplication
      module Kookaburra
        ::Kookaburra.adapter = Capybara

        # Note: the following assigned classes are defined under your
        # application's namespace, e.g. MyApplication::Kookaburra::APIDriver
        ::Kookaburra.api_driver = APIDriver
        ::Kookaburra.given_driver = GivenDriver
        ::Kookaburra.ui_driver = UIDriver

        ::Kookaburra.test_data_setup do
          provide_collection :accounts
          # See section on Test Data for more examples of what can go here.
        end
      end
    end

### RSpec ###

For [RSpec] [4] integration tests, just add the following to
`spec/support/kookaburra_setup.rb`:

    require 'my_application/kookaburra'

    RSpec.configure do |c|
      c.include(Kookaburra, :type => :request)
    end

### Cucumber ###

For Cucumber, add the following to `features/support/kookaburra_setup.rb`:

    require 'my_application/kookaburra'

    Kookaburra.adapter = Capybara
    World(Kookaburra)

    Before do
      # Ensure that there isn't state-leakage between scenarios
      kookaburra_reset!
    end

This will cause the #api, #given and #ui methods will be available in your
Cucumber step definitions.

## Defining Your Testing DSL ##

Kookaburra attempts to extract some common patterns that make it easier to use
the Window Driver pattern along with various Ruby testing frameworks, but you
still need to define your own testing DSL. An acceptance testing stack using
Kookaburra has the following four layers:

1. The **Business Specification Language** (Cucumber scenarios and step definitions)
2. The **Domain Driver** (Kookaburra::GivenDriver and Kookaburra::UIDriver)
3. The **Window Driver** (Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent)
4. The **Application Driver** (Capybara and Rack::Test)

### The Business Specification Language ###

The business specification language consists of the highest-level descriptions
of a feature that are suitable for sharing with the non/less-technical
stakeholders on a project.

Gherkin is the external DSL used by Cucumber for this purpose, and you might
have the following scenario defined for an e-commerce application:

    # purchase_items_in_cart.feature

    Feature: Purchase Items in Cart

      Scenario: Using Existing Billing and Shipping Information
        
        Given I have an existing account
        And I have previously specified default payment options
        And I have previously specified default shipping options
        And I have an item in my shopping cart

        When I sign in to my account
        And I choose to check out

        Then I see my order summary
        And I see that my default payment options will be used
        And I see that my default shipping options will be used

Note that the scenario is focused on business concepts versus interface details,
i.e. you "choose to check out" rather than "click on the checkout button". If
for some reason your e-commerce system was going to be a terminal application
rather than a web application, you would not need to change this scenario at
all, because the actual business concepts described would not change.

### The Domain Driver ###

The Domain Driver layer is where you build up an internal DSL that describes the
business concepts of your application at a fairly high level. It consists of
three top-level drivers: the `APIDriver` (available via `#api`) for interacting
with your application's external API, the `GivenDriver` (available via `#given`)
which really just wraps the `APIDriver` and is used to set up state for your
tests, and the UIDriver (available via `#given`) for describing the tasks that a
user can accomplish with the application.

Given the Cucumber scenario above, the step definitions call into the Domain
Driver layer to interact with your application:

    # step_definitions/various_steps.rb

    Given "I have an existing account" do
      given.existing_account(:my_account)
    end

    Given "I have previously specified default payment options" do
      given.default_payment_options_specified_for(:my_account)
    end

    Given "I have previously specified default shipping options" do
      given.default_shipping_options_specified_for(:my_account)
    end

    Given "I have an item in my shopping cart" do
      given.an_item_in_my_shopping_cart(:my_account)
    end

    When "I sign in to my account" do
      ui.sign_in(:my_account)
    end

    When "I choose to check out" do
      ui.choose_to_check_out
    end

    Then "I see my order summary" do
      ui.order_summary.should be_visible
    end

    Then "I see that my default payment options will be used" do
      ui.order_summary.payment_options.should be_account_default_options
    end

    Then "I see that my default shipping options will be used" do
      ui.order_summary.shipping_options.should be_account_default_options
    end

The step definitions contain neither explicitly shared state (instance
variables) nor any logic branches; they are simply wrappers around calls into
the Domain Driver layer. There are a couple of advantages to this approach.
First, because step definitions are so simple, it isn't necessary to force *Very
Specific Wording* on the business analyst/product owner who is writing the
specs. For instance, if she writes "I see a summary of my order" in another
scenario, it's not a big deal to have the following in your step definitions (as
long as the author of the spec confirms that they really mean the same thing):

    Then "I see my order summary" do
      ui.order_summary.should be_visible
    end

    Then "I see a summary of my order" do
      ui.order_summary.should be_visible
    end

The step definitions are nothing more than a natural language reference to an
action in the Domain Driver; there is no overwhelming maintenance cost to the
slight duplication, and it opens up the capacity for more readable Gherkin
specs. The fewer false road blocks you put between your product owner and a
written specification, the easier it becomes to ensure her participation in this
process.

The second advantage is that by pushing all of the complexity down into the
Domain Driver, it's now trivial to reuse the exact same code in
developer-centric integration tests. This ensures you have parity between the
way the automated acceptance tests run and any additional testing that the
development team needs to add in. You could write the same test using just
RSpec as follows:

    # spec/integration/purchase_items_in_cart_spec.rb
    
    describe "Purchase Items in Cart" do
      example "Using Existing Billing and Shipping Information" do
        given.existing_account(:my_account)
        given.default_payment_options_specified_for(:my_account)
        given.default_shipping_options_specified_for(:my_account)
        given.an_item_in_my_shopping_cart(:my_account)

        ui.sign_in(:my_account)
        ui.choose_to_check_out

        ui.order_summary.should be_visible
        ui.order_summary.payment_options.should be_account_default_options
        ui.order_summary.shipping_options.should be_account_default_options
      end
    end

Whether in Cucumber step definitions or developer integration tests, you will
usually interact only with the GivenDriver and the UIDriver.

#### TestData ####

`Kookaburra::TestData` is the component via which the `GivenDriver` and the
`UIDriver` share information. For instance, if you create a user account via the
`GivenDriver`, you would store the login credentials for that account in the
`TestData` instance, so the UIDriver knows what to use when you tell it to
`#sign_in`. This is what allows the Cucumber step definitions to remain free
from explicitly shared state.

The `TestData` class can be configured to contain both collections of test data
as well as default data that can be used as a starting point for creating new
resources in the application. To configure `TestData`, call
`Kookaburra.test_data_setup` with a block (usually in your
`lib/my_application/kookaburra.rb` file):

    module MyApplication
      module Kookaburra
        # ...
        ::Kookaburra.test_data_setup do
          provide_collection :animals
          set_default :animal,
            :name => 'horse'
            :size => 'large',
            :number_of_legs => 4
        end
      end
    end

Then, in any context where you have an instance of `TestData` (such as in
`GivenDriver` or `UIDriver`), you can add/retrieve items to/from collections and
access default data:

    class MyApplication::Kookaburra::GivenDriver < Kookaburra::GivenDriver
      def existing_account(nickname)
        default_account_data = test_data.default(:account)
        # do something to create account in application
        # ...
        # make the details of the new account available to the rest of the test
        test_data.accounts[nickname] = account
      end
    end

    class MyApplication::Kookaburra::UIDriver < Kookaburra::UIDriver
      def sign_in(account_nickname)
        # pull stored account details from TestData
        account_info = test_data.accounts[account_nickname]

        # do something to log in using that account_info
      end
    end

#### APIDriver ####

The `Kookaburra::APIDriver` is used to interact with an application's external
web services API. You tell Kookaburra about your API by creating a subclass of
`Kookaburra::APIDriver` for your application:

    # lib/my_application/kookaburra/api_driver.rb

    class MyApplication::Kookaburra::APIDriver < Kookaburra::APIDriver
      def create_account(account_data)
        post_as_json 'Account', 'api/v1/accounts', :account => account_data
        hash_from_response_json[:account]
      end
    end

#### GivenDriver ####

The `Kookaburra::GivenDriver` is used to create a particular "preexisting"
state within your application's data and ensure you have a handle to that data
(when needed) prior to interacting with the UI. Like the `APIDriver`, you will
create a subclass of `Kookaburra::GivenDriver` in which you will create part of
the Domain Driver DSL for your application:

    # lib/my_application/kookaburra/given_driver.rb

    class MyApplication::Kookaburra::GivenDriver < Kookaburra::GivenDriver
      def existing_account(nickname)
        # grab the default account details and add a unique username and
        # password
        account_data = test_data.default(:account)
        account_data[:username] = "test-user-#{`uuidgen`.strip}"
        account_data[:password] = account_data[:username] + "-password"

        # use the API to create the account in the application
        account_details = api.create_account(account_data)

        # merge in the password (since API doesn't return it) and store details
        # in the TestData instance
        account_details.merge(:password => account_data[:password])
        test_data.accounts[nickname] = account_details
      end
    end

#### UIDriver ####

`Kookaburra::UIDriver` provides the necessary tools for driving your
application's user interface using the Window Driver pattern. You will subclass
`Kookaburra::UIDriver` for your application and implement your testing DSL
within your subclass:

    # lib/my_application/kookaburra/ui_driver.rb

    class MyApplication::Kookaburra::UIDriver < Kookaburra::UIDriver
      # makes an instance of MyApplication::Kookaburra::UIDriver::SignInScreen
      # available via the instance method #sign_in_screen
      ui_component :sign_in_screen

      def sign_in(account_nickname)
        account = test_data.accounts[account_nickname]
        navigate_to :sign_in_screen
        sign_in_screen.submit_login(account[:username], account[:password])
      end
    end

### The Window Driver Layer ###

While your `GivenDriver` and `UIDriver` provide a DSL that represents actions
your users can perform in your application, the [Window Driver] [1] layer describes
the individual user interface components that the user interacts with to perform
these tasks. By describing each interface component using an OOP approach, it is
much easier to maintain your acceptance/integration tests, because the
implementation details of each component are captured in a single place. If/when
that implementation changes, you can---for example---fix every single test that
needs to log a user into the system just by updating the SignInScreen class.

You describe the various user interface components by sub-classing
`Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent`:

    # lib/my_application/ui_driver/sign_in_screen.rb

    class MyApplication::Kookaburra::UIDriver::SignInScreen < Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent
      component_locator '#new_user_session'
      component_path '/session/new'

      def username
        in_component { browser.find('#session_username').value }
      end

      def username=(new_value)
        fill_in('#session_username', :with => new_value)
      end

      def password
        in_component { browser.find('#session_password').value }
      end

      def password=(new_value)
        fill_in('#session_password', :with => new_value)
      end

      def submit!
        click_on('Sign In')
        no_500_error!
      end

      def submit_login(username, password)
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
        submit!
      end
    end
