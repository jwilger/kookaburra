      # 1) If the matcher is called on an Array, a direct comparison will be

      # specified scoping or mapping methods have) been applied.
      #
      # 2) If the matcher is called on an object that responds to the
      # collection_method (which defaults to the collection_key but can be
      # overridden with "#using"), the result of actual#collection_method will
      # be used for the comparison.
      #
      # When using method #2, if the match is unsuccessful, failure won't be
      # reported immediately; instead, the comparison will be retried
      # continuously for the number of seconds specified by wait_for (see
      # "#initialize").  This is the recommended usage, and is useful for taking
      # into account possible rendering delays.
