    # UIComponent is intended to be subclassed to represent each component of
    # your application-under-test's user interface. The purpose of the
    # UIComponent object is to abstract away the implementation details of your
    # interface when testing and allow you to concentrate on testing your
    # business requirements. For instance, a UIComponent subclass for your
    # sign-up form might have accessors for the individual fields as well as
    # methods that allow you to perform distinct operations:
    #
    # @example SignUpForm component
    #   class SignUpForm < Kookaburra::UIDriver::UIComponent
    #     def component_path
    #       '/signup'
    #     end
    #
    #     def component_locator
    #       '#sign_up_form'
    #     end

    #       find('#user_email').value
    #     end

    #     def email=(new_email)
    #       fill_in 'user_email', :with => new_email
    #     end

    #     def password
    #       find('#user_password').value

    #       fill_in 'user_password', :with => new_password

    #
    #     def password_confirmation
    #       find('#user_password_confirmation').value
    #     end

    #     def password_confirmation=(new_password_confirmation)
    #       fill_in 'user_password_confirmation', :with => new_password_confirmation
