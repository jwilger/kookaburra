  # You UIDriver subclass is where you define the DSL for testing your
  # application via its user interface. Methods defined in your DSL should
  # represent business actions rather than user interface manipulations. A
  # good test of this is whether the names of your methods would need to change
  # significantly if the application needed to be implemented in a vastly
  # different manner (a text-only terminal app vs. a web app, for instance).
  #
  # @abstract Subclass and implement your UI testing DSL
  #
  # @example UIDriver subclass
  #   module MyApp
  #     module Kookaburra
  #       class UIDriver < ::Kookaburra::UIDriver
  #         ui_component :widget_list, WidgetList
  #         ui_component :questionnaire, Questionnaire
  #
  #         def view_the_widgets
  #           address_bar.go_to(widget_list)
  #         end
  #
  #         def view_all_of_the_widgets
  #           address_bar.go_to(widget_list.url(:include_hidden => true))
  #         end
  #
  #         def complete_the_widget_questionnaire(answers = {})
  #           address_bar.go_to(questionnaire)
  #           questionnaire.page_1.submit(answers[:page_1])
  #           questionnaire.page_2.submit(answers[:page_2])
  #           questionnaire.page_3.submit(answers[:page_3])

  # actions into multiple classes. The top-level {UIDriver} can have sub-drivers
